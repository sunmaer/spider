Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining)refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials.In this talk, I will focus on two important tasks in sentiment analysis:Cross-lingual and Cross-domain sentiment classification. The fundamentalchallenge of the former task stems from a lack of overlap between the featurespaces of source language data and that of target language data. While the key challengefor the latter task is how to reduce the domain discrepancy and manual labelingcosts. To address the above challenges, I will present two novel deep neuralnetwork recently published in my group: one is called weakly shared deep neuralnetworks (WSDNNs), and the other is called bi-transferring deep neural networks(BTDNNs).
