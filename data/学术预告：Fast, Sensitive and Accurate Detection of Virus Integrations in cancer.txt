The study of virus
integrations in human genome is important since virus integrations were shown
to be associated with diseases. In the literature, few methods have been
proposed that predict virus integrations using next generation sequencing
datasets. Although they work, they are slow and are not very sensitive.
This talk introduces
a new method BatVI to predict viral integrations. Our method uses a fast
screening method to filter out chimeric reads containing possible viral
integrations. Next, sensitive alignments of these candidate chimeric reads are
called by BLAST. Chimeric reads that are co-localized in the human genome are
clustered. Finally, by assembling the chimeric reads in each cluster, high
confident virus integration sites are extracted.
Finally, we applied
BatVI to two liver cancer datasets. We will discuss the findings we have.
