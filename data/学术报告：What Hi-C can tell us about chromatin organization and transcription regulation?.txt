One of the new sequencing technique is the
so called Hi-C(High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture). It aims to
catch the chromatin structure by observing spatial proximal DNA sequence
ligation through pair-end sequencing. The resultant data can be represented as
a 2-D matrix with entries (i,j) giving number of ligations observed between
position i and j on the genome. HiC data is now available in a lot of model
organisms including human, mouse, fly and yeast. The most significant global
feature in human and mouse HiC interaction is the plaid pattern, which lead to
existence of compartment. There are a lot of unexplained patterns and the
causal connection between HiC data and genome regulation is still to be
explored.
Dr. Qin’s research is in the areas of
statistical genetics, genomics and bioinformatics. Motivated by scientific
needs in these area and new technologies, he is undertaking both methodological
and collaborative research. A major focus of his research is on developing and
evaluating model-based methods to analyze genetics and genomics data, in
particular, next generation sequencing data, and on developing software so that
the methods can be easily adopted by the research community.
