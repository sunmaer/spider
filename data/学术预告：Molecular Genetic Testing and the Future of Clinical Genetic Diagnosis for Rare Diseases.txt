Craniosynostosis, the
premature fusion of the cranial sutures, is a serious disorder with a
prevalence of 1 in 2,000-2,500. Genetic causes are associated with an increased
frequency of complications, often leading to long-term health problems. Despite
recent successes in identifying new genetic causes, a significant proportion of
patients (~60% of individuals analysed by exome or whole genome sequencing)
remain undiagnosed. One potential explanation is that some causative variants
lie in non-coding DNA, in regions not routinely analysed in NGS data.
Active regulatory elements
are identified by looking at genome-wide enrichments of histone K27ac and K4me1
(enhancer) or K4me3 (promoter), using ChIP-Seq approach in human and murine
embryonic suture materials. In addition, ATAC and DNase-Seq are also applied on
suture-derived cells, to query the location of open chromatin as well as the
binding of transcription factors over the regulatory elements. Targeted
resequencing and whole genome sequencing are used to profile alternations of
DNA sequences in undiagnosed patient cohort. Possible causative variants are
subsequently denoted by superimposing locations of regulatory elements over the
list of sequence variants. These genetics discoveries can then be understood by
integrating the information with multiple approaches from chromatin
higher-order structures study, cell and development biology and mouse genetics.
This research will lead to a
better understanding of craniosynostosis and cranial suture development. It
would also provide a clearer prognosis for patients and families and end their
journey of diagnosis which may have lasted for years or decades.
